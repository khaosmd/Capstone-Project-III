# Capstone-Project-III
Java OOP Project that makes use of refactoring, exception handling and Text I/O

The third version of the initial Capstone Project incorporates exception handling, refactoring and text i/o in order to improve the project. A Javadoc has also been generated for the program.

The user is now given the option to load projects by means of a text file, instead of having to manually input the data. A list of project objects is created from this data, and a user can add, select, update or finalise any object on the list. They can also see a list of projects that still need to be completed or that are past their due date.

The list of projects, including those with updated details, is written to a text file once the program ends.
